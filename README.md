This is a technical test project for a Fullstack position at [Filup](https://filup.mx/)

## Requirements

To run this project you just need to have node and npm install. After you clone it on your local machine, you just run npm install to get all dependencies. After this, you will need to do the mongo setup. For this project I use a cloud database using Mongo Atlas, in the .env you just need to fill the variables with your own data to connecto to the database. Finally, you just run npm start or npm run dev to use nodemon to get your server up and running.
